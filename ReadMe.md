# Natours Landing Page

This project is a responsive landing page for a fictional company called **Natours**, which offers nature tours and adventures.

It was built as part of the _Advanced CSS and Sass_ course on Udemy by Jonas Schmedtmann. The main goal of the project is to practice modern CSS and Sass techniques, including the 7-1 architecture, BEM methodology, animations, and responsive layouts.

The landing page includes several sections such as a hero header, about, features, popular tours, customer stories, and a booking form. It uses advanced CSS features like gradients, clip-path, shape-outside, background video, and smooth animations to create a visually engaging design.
